# Consumie Recommendations

A simple API for generated recommended content for Consumie.com (sample results of which can be seen [here](https://consumie.com/movie/sunset-boulevard)). Makes use of keywords harvested from various datasources to find items with similar cast, crew, genres, etc., then weights them and returns relevant content.

Additional endpoint currently in development to provide user-specific recommendations, built off the item-specific similarities
